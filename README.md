- 👋 Hi, I’m @CharlieC512
- 👀 I’m interested in Verilog/Perl/Tcl.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning RTL coding and further my postgraduate study in UK about mobile and personal communications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to improve myself and learn from others code here. Of course, I'd like to make my own contribution if that is possible.
